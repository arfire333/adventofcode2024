# Advent of Code 2024
Flutter solutions for Advent of Code 2024.  Visualizations will be made as time permits.

## Solutions with visualizations.
- Day 1 - Very basic proof of concept.

## Usage
- Log into Advent of Code via a web browser and obtain a session cookie.
- Compile and run the software.
- Open the drawer and click on the elf.
- Enter your session cooking in the text box then press.
- Return to the drawer and select the day you wish to see.
- Click the play button to get the results.
- The trash can's will erase the puzzle data and puzzle description respectively.

## Notes
- While written in flutter, it has only been tested successfuly on Windows and Android.  It fails to run on the web.  At least via VSCode.  This appears to be because of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when trying to get the puzzle input data but has not been confirmed.
- Code is not necessarily _production_ ready.  Some days are better than others.  Recommendations for improvements are welcome.
